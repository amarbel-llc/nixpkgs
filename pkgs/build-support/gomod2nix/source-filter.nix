# Source-tree filter for the go-pkgs producer convention (RFC 0001).
# Returns a *derivation* whose output is the filtered tree of `src` —
# keeps Go-relevant regular files (matched against the default keep-set
# or caller-supplied `extras` regex patterns). Directories are always
# traversed so the filter composes on deep trees; empty directories
# that have no matching descendants are preserved in the output
# (harmless for `go build`).
#
# Patterns are POSIX extended regex (builtins.match semantics), NOT
# globs. Examples: "^doc/.*" "^VERSION$" ".*\\.tmpl$".
#
# Implementation notes:
#
# 1. `lib.sources.sourceByRegex` applies the regex list to both files
#    and directories, so deep trees fail to traverse unless every
#    intermediate directory also matches some regex. To keep the
#    user-facing contract simple (the regex list is matched against
#    files only) this helper applies the directory-always-allow rule
#    in its own predicate.
#
# 2. Three flake-schema gates apply at three different layers:
#    - `nix eval` accepts any value.
#    - `nix build .#go-pkgs` accepts derivations, paths, or
#      strings-with-context that look like store paths.
#    - `nix flake check` is strictest: the value MUST be a derivation
#      (`lib.isDerivation` returns true; equivalent to checking for
#      `type = "derivation"`).
#
#    A bare `lib.cleanSourceWith` invocation returns a set with
#    `outPath`, which fails the `nix build` gate (see
#    amarbel-llc/nixpkgs#38). A bare `builtins.path` invocation
#    returns a string-with-context, which passes `nix build` but
#    fails `nix flake check` (see amarbel-llc/nixpkgs#44).
#
#    To satisfy all three gates this helper wraps the filtered
#    `builtins.path` result in a `runCommand` derivation that copies
#    the filtered tree into `$out`. `preferLocalBuild = true` +
#    `allowSubstitutes = false` keeps the wrap-step cheap and local.
