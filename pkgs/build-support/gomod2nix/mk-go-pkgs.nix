# mkGoPkgs — canonical producer-side helper for the flake-input-go_mod
# protocol (RFC 0001 § Producer interface).
#
# Returns the two flake outputs RFC 0001 mandates:
#
#   go-pkgs       — prod shape: *.go (excluding *_test.go), module
#                   files, workspace files, plus caller-supplied
#                   `extras`. Downstream prod consumers bridge against
#                   this by default.
#
#   go-pkgs-test  — superset: go-pkgs + *_test.go + testdata/** +
#                   caller-supplied `testExtras`. Used for self-
#                   consumption (a producer building itself from its
#                   own published artifact, exercising its own tests)
#                   and for downstream consumers that need to run the
#                   producer's tests against the bridged source.
#
# Implementation notes (informed by madder#212's inline contract test):
#
# 1. The testdata predicate matches both root-anchored (`^testdata/.*`,
#    for repos with a top-level `testdata/`) and nested
#    (`.*/testdata/.*`, for fixtures under internal packages). Both
#    patterns are needed in the same convention because Go module
#    layouts differ between single-module-at-root and subdirectory
#    producers.
#
# 2. The `runCommand` wrap is essentially free (<1s on madder's first
#    eval); `preferLocalBuild = true` + `allowSubstitutes = false`
#    keeps the wrap-step cheap and local.
#
# 3. The contract test for this helper is *self-consumption*: a
#    producer's own `buildGoApplication { src = pkgs.go-pkgs-test;
#    pwd = pkgs.go-pkgs-test; }` builds and tests cleanly. Without
#    self-consumption a producer can publish `go-pkgs-test` that
#    subtly fails downstream and never notice. RFC 0001 § Producer
#    interface carries the corresponding SHOULD recommendation.
