# Numtide go2nix as an overlay build helper

## Problem Statement

The fork's Go projects (`dagnabit`, `madder`, `maneater`, `dodder`, `chrest`,
`nebulous`) are multi-package repos: each holds several `cmd/*` binaries plus
shared library packages. The current build path (`buildGoApplication` from
the vendored `gomod2nix`) treats each application as an opaque unit — when a
single leaf package changes, every binary built from the same module
rebuilds, even if the change can't possibly have affected most of them.

`numtide/go2nix` is a Nix-native Go builder that models the **package
graph**, not just the module set: the lockfile pins modules, but Nix
derivations are produced per-package. Architecturally similar to Bazel's
`rules_go`, with a much narrower scope. For monorepos with several binaries
sharing a heavy dependency graph, the unit of cache reuse moves from
"the whole app" to "individual Go packages."

A second motivation, beyond cache reuse, is to push **codegen into the
Nix layer**. Several of the fork's Go projects depend on codegen tools
that today are invoked either as a `preBuild` shell fragment in the
consumer's Nix derivation (e.g. `madder/go/default.nix` runs
`dagnabit export` in `preBuild`) or — more painfully — as a manual step
developers re-run during dev loops outside Nix (`go run` against
already-generated sources). With per-package Nix derivations, the
codegen step would become its own first-class derivation node:
`dagnabit`-built binaries would do their graph export at Nix build
time once per input change, the result would be cached by Nix, and
**both** `nix build` and bare-`go run` dev loops would consume the same
cached artifact instead of re-generating per dev iteration. The
ambition generalizes — `amarbel-llc/tommy` and other codegen
pipelines should follow the same shape, with Nix becoming the
canonical codegen layer rather than an opaque pre-build hook each
consumer rewires by hand.

This FDR exists so downstream repos in the fork can point to a single
write-up when deciding whether to migrate or wait. **Status is
`exploring`**: numtide flags the project as experimental upstream
(API and lockfile may change without notice), so this fork has not
committed to shipping it.

## Interface

The intent (not yet implemented) is to expose `numtide/go2nix` as an
**overlay-only** addition, alongside — not replacing — `buildGoApplication`
from the vendored `gomod2nix`. The two helpers would coexist; consumers
opt in per-project.

The exposed surface from `overlays/amarbel-packages.nix` would be:

| Attribute | Source | Purpose |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| `pkgs.go2nix.buildGoApplication` | numtide goEnv | Per-package builder, default mode (requires Nix plugin) |
| `pkgs.go2nix.buildGoApplicationExperimental` | numtide goEnv | Per-package builder, recursive-nix mode (requires Nix ≥ 2.34 + experimental features) |
| `pkgs.go2nix-cli` | numtide flake | The `go2nix generate` / `go2nix check` CLI |
| `pkgs.go2nix-nix-plugin` | numtide flake | The `libgo2nix_plugin.so` Nix evaluator plugin |

Naming notes:

- `pkgs.go2nix` is namespaced as an attrset rather than flat to avoid
  shadowing `pkgs.buildGoApplication` (the gomod2nix one).
- `pkgs.go2nix-cli` is split out because `pkgs.gomod2nix` already holds
  the gomod2nix CLI — both can't claim the same flat name.
- The CLI ships its own lockfile format (`go2nix.toml`), incompatible with
  `gomod2nix.toml`. Projects that adopt this builder maintain a `go2nix.toml`
  separate from any existing `gomod2nix.toml`.

The plugin (`pkgs.go2nix-nix-plugin`) provides
`builtins.resolveGoPackages`, which the default-mode builder calls during
evaluation. The overlay can ship the `.so`, but **loading it is host-side
evaluator config**, not something an overlay can do. Users must add it
to `nix.conf` via `plugin-files = ...` or pass `--option plugin-files
<path>` per invocation. NixOS users would set
`nix.settings.plugin-files`.

`buildGoApplicationExperimental` avoids the plugin entirely by using
recursive-nix with content-addressed derivations and dynamic derivations.
It needs Nix ≥ 2.34 with three experimental features enabled
(`recursive-nix`, `ca-derivations`, `dynamic-derivations`). For a fork
that's already comfortable with experimental Nix features in its
devshells, this is arguably a cleaner integration path.

## Examples

A downstream consumer (e.g. `madder`) would migrate its `go/default.nix`
roughly as follows:

```nix
# Before — gomod2nix path:
{ pkgs, ... }:
let
  madder = pkgs.buildGoApplication {
    pname = "madder";
    src = ./.;
    pwd = ./.;
    subPackages = [ "cmd/madder" "cmd/madder-cache" "cmd/madder-gen_man" ];
    modules = ./gomod2nix.toml;
  };
in {
  packages.default = madder;
}

# After — go2nix path (illustrative, not yet implemented):
{ pkgs, ... }:
let
  madder = pkgs.go2nix.buildGoApplication {
    pname = "madder";
    src = ./.;
    goLock = ./go2nix.toml;
    version = "0.1.0";
  };
in {
  packages.default = madder;
}
```

To regenerate the lockfile after a `go.mod` change:

```bash
$ go2nix generate .         # writes ./go2nix.toml from go.mod / go.sum
$ go2nix check              # validates the lockfile is in sync
```

To use the default builder, the evaluator must have the plugin loaded.
For a one-off invocation:

```bash
$ nix build \
    --option plugin-files \
    "$(nix build --no-link --print-out-paths nixpkgs#go2nix-nix-plugin)/lib/nix/plugins/libgo2nix_plugin.so" \
    .#default
```

For permanent setup, in `~/.config/nix/nix.conf` (or `nix.settings` on
NixOS):

```
plugin-files = /nix/store/...-go2nix-nix-plugin/lib/nix/plugins/libgo2nix_plugin.so
```

## Cross-flake Go-module composition

The codegen-at-Nix-build-time vision (see Problem Statement) hinges
on a question bigger than the choice between gomod2nix and go2nix:
**how does a Go module exposed by one Nix flake get imported into
another Go module's Nix flake?** Today, cross-repo Go composition is
owned end-to-end by `go.mod` / `go.sum` / `replace` directives; Nix
only packages the result Go has already resolved. When the producer
flake's output is itself a generated Go source tree (e.g.
`dagnabit`'s graph export, `tommy`'s code generation), there is no
Nix-native path to feed that output into a consumer's Go module
without round-tripping through Go's module system.

Two strategies are in play, at different points on the ambition axis.

### Path A — Bridge: synthesize `go.mod` replace directives from flake inputs

Keep `go.mod` as the integration point, but make a flake input drive
the `replace` line. gomod2nix's `buildGoApplication` already symlinks
local-path replaces from `go.mod` into `vendor/<name>` at build time
(the `localReplaceAttrs` / `commands` block in
`pkgs/build-support/gomod2nix/default.nix`). Extend the builder with
a `goFlakeInputs` arg accepting a map of Go module path → flake-input
derivation; an intermediate Nix-eval-time derivation runs `go mod edit
-replace=<module>=<input>/...` to overlay those entries onto the
organic `go.mod`, and the merged file is what `mkVendorEnv` sees.

Resolved sub-decisions:

1. **Merge primitive: `go mod edit -replace`.** Synthetic deps overlay
   onto the organic `go.mod`; only flake-input-driven entries are
   synthetic. Most projects have a mix — `cobra`, `golang.org/x/...`,
   etc. stay organic. The version pin in the organic `require` line
   becomes vestigial: the replace path wins at build time.
2. **Inline derivation arg, not a manifest file.** Caller passes
   `goFlakeInputs` directly to the builder; no separate
   `flake-go-inputs.toml` or equivalent. Single source of truth for
   synthetic versions = the flake input rev (via `flake.lock`).
3. **Local `go build` outside nix is unsupported.** All Go work
   happens inside `nix develop` or via `nix build`. The merged
   `go.mod` is the only file the build sees; no dual-path concerns.
   `mkGoEnv` and `buildGoApplication` apply the same merge logic;
   `go.work` indirection becomes unnecessary.

Lockstep collapse: bumping a sibling Go module today requires editing
three places in lockstep — `go.mod`'s pseudo-version,
`gomod2nix.toml`'s hash, `flake.lock`'s rev. With the bridge, only
the flake-input rev matters; the merged `go.mod`'s replace points at
the new store path automatically, and `gomod2nix.toml` only tracks
the *organic* surface.

Status: **exploratory, not implemented.** The motivating bug —
madder's `dodder-blob_store-config` → `blob_store-config` rename,
where the flake input bumped but `go.mod`'s pin lagged into a
runtime panic — is resolvable by hand. When the rename pattern bites
again, or when a new fork project hits the same shape, the bridge is
the starting point.

Adjacent infra issues surfaced during the originating investigation:
[amarbel-llc/dodder#125](https://github.com/amarbel-llc/dodder/issues/125),
[amarbel-llc/dodder#126](https://github.com/amarbel-llc/dodder/issues/126),
[amarbel-llc/clown#39](https://github.com/amarbel-llc/clown/issues/39).

### Path B — Native: `resolveGoPackages` across flake inputs

The fully-Nix-native path. numtide go2nix's plugin exposes
`builtins.resolveGoPackages`, which the default-mode builder calls
during evaluation. Whether that resolution can reach across flake
inputs — whether a producer flake can expose its Go package graph as
a Nix value the consumer's `resolveGoPackages` will consume, without
each flake re-vendoring the full transitive package graph — is not
clear from the upstream docs. This is the most consequential
unanswered question for the codegen ambition and is logically prior
to migrating any fork repo to go2nix.

If path B is viable, path A becomes a transitional shim. If path B
is fundamentally limited (e.g. `resolveGoPackages` cannot cross
flake boundaries), path A is likely the durable answer and go2nix's
value proposition narrows to per-package cache reuse within a single
flake.

## Limitations

- **Upstream is experimental.** numtide/go2nix's README explicitly warns
  that "APIs and lockfile formats may change without notice." A fork that
  ships this overlay attr is opting into upstream churn — every numtide
  release may require lockfile regeneration and possibly call-site
  adjustments. There is no semver discipline being promised.

- **Default mode requires a Nix C++ plugin.** This is fundamentally
  outside what an overlay can manage. Each consumer of the overlay must
  add `plugin-files` to their host's `nix.conf` (or NixOS configuration).
  Devshells alone cannot wire this in; the plugin has to be loaded by the
  evaluator at evaluation time, before any flake code runs.

- **Experimental mode locks consumers to recent Nix.** The plugin-free
  `buildGoApplicationExperimental` requires Nix ≥ 2.34 with
  `recursive-nix`, `ca-derivations`, and `dynamic-derivations` experimental
  features enabled. This may not be acceptable in every consumer's CI or
  contributor environment.

- **Lockfile divergence.** `go2nix.toml` and `gomod2nix.toml` are
  schema-incompatible. A project that adopts go2nix without removing its
  gomod2nix.toml has to keep both in sync manually — or pick one and
  delete the other. There is no migration tool today.

- **Name collision on `buildGoApplication`.** numtide's function and the
  vendored gomod2nix function share a name. The overlay must namespace
  numtide's under `pkgs.go2nix.*` to keep both available, which means
  call sites are visually distinct but readers may still confuse them.

- **No interaction yet defined with `buildGoRace` / `buildGoCover`.**
  This fork added `buildGoRace` and `buildGoCover` as ergonomic wrappers
  around the gomod2nix `buildGoApplication` (see
  `pkgs/build-support/gomod2nix/default.nix` and the More Information
  section). Whether and how those wrappers should compose with
  numtide's per-package builder is unanswered. The naive shape
  (`overrideAttrs` on the per-package leaf derivation) likely doesn't
  work, since per-package builds use `go tool compile/link` rather than
  `go install`, and `-race` / `-cover` interact differently at that
  level. Concrete experimentation needed before a recommendation.

- **Per-package caching's win is monorepo-shaped.** The benefit only
  shows up when (a) the project has many packages, (b) builds are run
  often enough that cache reuse matters, and (c) changes are typically
  localized. Single-binary, single-package projects gain little.

## More Information

- Upstream: <https://github.com/numtide/go2nix> (README dated 2026, marked
  experimental)
- Related project comparison (from numtide's README): `buildGoModule`,
  `gomod2nix`, `gobuild.nix`, `nix-gocacheprog` — each occupies a
  different tradeoff point on caching granularity vs. operational
  complexity.
- Sibling work in this fork: issue
  [amarbel-llc/nixpkgs#13](https://github.com/amarbel-llc/nixpkgs/issues/13)
  added `buildGoRace` and `buildGoCover` wrappers around the gomod2nix
  `buildGoApplication` (`pkgs/build-support/gomod2nix/default.nix`).
  Composition story between those wrappers and numtide go2nix is
  open — see Limitations.
- Issue
  [amarbel-llc/nixpkgs#12](https://github.com/amarbel-llc/nixpkgs/issues/12)
  is the originating exploration of "flake input as canonical Go
  module source." Its strategic framing and resolved sub-decisions
  were absorbed into the *Cross-flake Go-module composition* section
  above; the issue stays open as a tracking surface for the next
  trigger event.
- Downstream consumers expected to evaluate against this FDR:
  `dagnabit`, `madder`, `maneater`, `dodder`, `chrest`, `nebulous`. Each
  should track its own decision in a downstream FDR pointing here.
- Codegen tools relevant to the Nix-as-codegen-layer ambition:
  `amarbel-llc/dagnabit` (graph export, currently invoked as a
  `preBuild` shell fragment in `madder/go/default.nix`),
  `amarbel-llc/tommy` (a generalization target — same shape applies).
  A future FDR may capture the codegen-as-Nix-derivation pattern
  independently of the choice of Go builder.
